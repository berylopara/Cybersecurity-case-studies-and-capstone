## 1️⃣ Network Security Analysis (Wireshark)

**Course:** Computer Networks and Network Security  
**Focus:** Packet analysis, endpoint protection, and firewall configuration  

This project involved using Wireshark to analyze TCP and UDP traffic in a controlled lab environment.  
The tasks included identifying suspicious network activity, applying packet filters, and documenting insights from captured traffic.  
Additionally, firewall rules and endpoint protection (via OpenEDR) were configured to simulate a secure small office/home office (SOHO) network environment.  
This project demonstrates my ability to monitor, analyze, and secure network infrastructure — core skills for SOC and security operations roles.

**Key Tools:** Wireshark, OpenEDR, Windows Firewall

## 2️⃣ Database Security & Vulnerabilities

**Course:** Database Essentials for Cybersecurity  
**Focus:** SQL operations, privilege management, encryption, and SQL injection mitigation  

This project focused on understanding database structures, user access control, and common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection.  
I executed CRUD operations, implemented MySQL user privileges, tested encryption using AES_ENCRYPT and AES_DECRYPT, and demonstrated secure query mitigation techniques with parameterized queries.  
The project also covered ethical handling of vulnerabilities, showing how to test and fix database flaws safely within lab environments.

**Key Tools:** MySQL, Python, SQL

## 3️⃣ Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) Framework

**Course:** Cybersecurity Compliance Frameworks, Standards, and Regulations  
**Focus:** GRC analysis, policy development, and compliance mapping  

This project explores major cybersecurity frameworks and standards, including NIST, ISO 27001, GDPR, and HIPAA.  
It summarizes their objectives, scope, and interrelationships while emphasizing the role of governance and compliance in managing enterprise risk.  
The project deliverable includes a structured PDF summary outlining each framework and its business application, showing strategic awareness and risk-oriented thinking.

**Key Frameworks:** NIST, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA

## 4️⃣ Threat Investigation & Incident Response

**Course:** Penetration Testing, Threat Hunting, and Digital Forensics  
**Focus:** Threat detection, log analysis, and incident response workflow  

This project used simulated logs and alerts to identify indicators of compromise (IoCs) using the Cowrie honeypot.  
It involved investigating SSH brute-force attempts, analyzing attack patterns, and summarizing findings in a structured incident report.  
The project highlights my ability to handle incident response procedures — from detection to containment — with a clear understanding of digital forensics fundamentals.

**Key Tools:** Cowrie, Docker, Linux CLI, Syslog
